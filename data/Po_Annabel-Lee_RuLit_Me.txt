   Annabel Lee
   Edgar Allan PoeIt was many and many a year ago,In a kingdom by the sea,That a maiden lived whom you may knowBy the name of ANNABEL LEE;—And this maiden she lived with no other thoughtThan to love and be loved by me.Iwas a child andShewas a child,In this kingdom by the sea,But we loved with a love that was more than love—I and my ANNABEL LEE—With a love that the wingéd seraphs of HeavenCoveted her and me.And this was the reason that, long ago,In this kingdom by the sea,A wind blew out of a cloud by nightChilling my ANNABEL LEE;So that her high–born kinsmen cameAnd bore her away from me,To shut her up, in a sepulchreIn this kingdom by the sea.The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,Went envying her and me;Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,In this kingdom by the sea)That the wind came out of the cloud, chillingAnd killing my ANNABEL LEE.But our love it was stronger by far than the loveOf those who were older than we—Of many far wiser than we—And neither the angels in Heaven aboveNor the demons down under the seaCan ever dissever my soul from the soulOf the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:—For the moon never beams without bringing me dreamsOf the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyesOf the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;And so, all the night–tide, I lie down by the sideOf my darling, my darling, my life and my brideIn her sepulchre there by the sea—In her tomb by the side of the sea.
